# Week 2 - SWE Skills Bootcamp JavaScript

---

## Overview

This repository contains basic JavaScript activities as well as a calculator web app I made alongside the bootcamp to help boost my skils and challenge myself during week 2 of the Software Engineering (SWE) skills bootcamp with JUST IT in the North East of England. The purpose of this project was to complete a series of fundamental JavaScript tasks assigned over a four-day period.

Each day contains (more or less) the same file structure, the purpose of each folder is to have a designated separator for each day to track my progress properly

**Please note:** While this project demonstrates my ability to meet core requirements and implement basic web development concepts, it does **not** represent the peak of my current skills or the complexity of projects I'm capable of undertaking. This was a foundational exercise, and I've already worked on more advanced concepts and projects beyond this initial bootcamp phase.

## Learnings
Through this project, I solidified my understanding of:

* Structuring web pages with semantic HTML.

* Styling elements and controlling layout using CSS, especially with Flexbox and Grid.

* Creating accessible and user-friendly forms.

* Organizing project files effectively.

## Future Enhancements
While this project fulfills the bootcamp's initial requirements, potential future enhancements could include:

* Adding JavaScript for dynamic content or form validation.

* Implementing responsive design for better mobile viewing.

* Refining the visual design and aesthetics.
